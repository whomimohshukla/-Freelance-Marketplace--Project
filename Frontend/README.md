# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```





Here’s what I found after inspecting both the 
BecomeFreelancer
 page and the existing Server codebase.

Front-end (page 
src/pages/BecomeFreelancer/index.tsx
) • Purely UI – lists categories, onboarding steps, benefits, etc.
• No direct API calls yet; it’s a marketing / onboarding page that should eventually redirect users to: – “Create Your Account” → user-registration flow
– A dashboard where freelancers can actually fill in their profile, add portfolio, manage proposals, etc.
Back-end status • Freelancer profile – Model: 
models/freelancer.model.js
 (very complete schema covering all items you listed in memories).
– Controller: 
controllers/core-Project/freelancer/freelancerProfile.controller.js
 (CRUD for profile, portfolio, skills, work experience, education, certifications, availability, stats, social, search, top-rated).
– Routes: 
routes/freelancer.routes.js
 mounted under /api/freelancers/*. • Projects & proposals – Routes present: 
routes/projectCRUD.routes.js
, 
projectRating.routes.js
 (not yet reviewed in depth).
– Controllers/models likely exist under controllers/core-Project/project/.... • Payments / escrow – 
routes/payments.routes.js
 with Razorpay order, capture, webhook, escrow release, refund.
– Background job jobs/escrowRelease.job.js. • Messaging / real-time chat – No routes found so far – probably still missing. • Reviews – 
routes/reviewFreelancer.routes.js
 present (needs audit).
What still needs to be wired • Front-end requests for creating / editing the freelancer profile, portfolio, skills, etc. should hit: POST /api/freelancers/profile GET /api/freelancers/profile/:userId PUT /api/freelancers/portfolio …and the other endpoints listed in the route file. • You’ll need React hooks / service layer (e.g., Axios) that: – Sends the JWT in Authorization: Bearer <token> (auth middleware expects it).
– Maps form inputs to the schema shape expected by those endpoints. • If you intend to let freelancers create proposals / bid on projects, confirm the controllers under project cover: – createProject, listProjects, createProposal, hire, milestones, etc.
– Otherwise we must implement those. • Real-time messaging is not in the server yet; plan to add Socket.IO or an events collection & polling.
Next steps I recommend
Decide which UI screen will actually POST the profile data (probably a multi-step form separate from the BecomeFreelancer landing page).
Create a small Axios service file (services/freelancer.ts) that wraps all /api/freelancers/* calls.
Test the existing routes with Postman to make sure they return the standard response format:
{ success: true, data: … }
Audit remaining server folders (project, payments, reviews) to ensure all endpoints you need are complete; stub any missing modules (proposals, messaging).
Hook up the UI to show freelancer search results (uses GET /api/freelancers/search with query params).
For payments, configure your Razorpay keys in 
.env
 and verify the webhook route in the dashboard.
Let me know which part you want to implement or wire up first—e.g., building the profile form, integrating the profile APIs, or fleshing out missing backend features (chat, proposals). I can help with code snippets or new endpoints as needed.
